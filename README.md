# SDE Interview App üïµÔ∏è
LIVE: [https://interview.pindej.cz/](https://interview.pindej.cz/)

This repository is an implementation of a web application written in Blazor WebAssembly. The app is meant to make company interviews easier, as it generates a random set of questions from provided dataset. The interviewer then doesn't have to think about what to ask about on the spot, but is rather guided, while it allows him to provide the feedback to managers or internal HR systems with ease.

The current feature set includes:
- answer rating
- notetaking
- question hotswap
- exporting rated and noted questions
